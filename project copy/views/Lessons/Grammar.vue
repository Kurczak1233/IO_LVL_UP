They built a “compound” microscope, so called because of its two lenses. The most significant development and use of the microscope during this period, however, belongs to another Dutch optician, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Born in Delft, Holland, he became skilled at (6) ... very sharp and accurate magnifying lenses. Some of his single-lens microscopes were able to</l>
