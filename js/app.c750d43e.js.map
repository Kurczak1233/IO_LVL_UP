A finished action with a result in the present</b> (focus on result).</p>\r\n<p> We often use the present perfect to talk about something that happened in the recent past, but that is <b>still true or important now.</b> Sometimes we can use the past simple here, especially in US English.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I've lost my keys (so I can't get into my house).</li>\r\n<li>She's hurt her leg (so she can't play tennis today).</li>\r\n<li>They've missed the bus (so they will be late).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b class=\"text-danger\">5: We can also use the present perfect to talk about something that happened recently</b>, even if there isn't a clear result in the present.</p>\r\n <p>This is common when we want to introduce news and we often use the words 'just / yet / already / recently'. However, the past simple is also correct in these cases, especially in US English.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Queen has given a speech.</li>\r\n<li>I've just seen Lucy.</li>\r\n<li>The Mayor has announced a new plan for the railways.</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<b>Been and Gone</b>\r\nIn this tense, we use both 'been' and 'gone' as the past participle of 'go', but in slightly different circumstances. We use 'been' (often when we talk about life experience) to mean that the person we're talking about visited the place and came back.\r\nI've been to Paris (in my life, but now I'm in London, where I live).\r\nShe has been to school today (but now she's back at home).\r\nThey have never been to California.\r\nWe use 'gone' (often when we are talking about an action with a result in the present) to mean that the person went to the place and is at the place now.\r\nWhere's John? He's gone to the shops (he's at the shops now).\r\nJulie has gone to Mexico (now she's in Mexico).\r\nThey've gone to Japan for three weeks (now they're in Japan).\r\n</b-col>\r\n</b-row>\r\n<b-row>\r\n  <b-col class=\"text-center mt-3\">\r\n      <p class=\"text-size-big\"><router-link to=\"/Grammar\" class=\"text-primary\">Return to grammar</router-link></p>\r\n  </b-col>\r\n</b-row>\r\n    </b-container>\r\n</b-container>\r\n</body>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport UserNavigation from '../../../src/components/UserNavigation.vue'\r\nexport default {\r\nname: 'TheoryB1PPC',\r\ncomponents: \r\n{\r\n  UserNavigation,\r\n},\r\ndata: function()\r\n{\r\n  return{\r\n    IsInGrammar: true,\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\r\n<style scoped>\r\na\r\n{\r\n  color: black;\r\n}\r\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./TheoryB1PPS.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./TheoryB1PPS.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./TheoryB1PPS.vue?vue&type=template&id=b8003f7c&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./TheoryB1PPS.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./TheoryB1PPS.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./TheoryB1PPS.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=b8003f7c&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"b8003f7c\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('body',[_c('UserNavigation',{attrs:{\"IsInGrammar\":_vm.IsInGrammar}}),_c('b-container',{staticClass:\"container text-center mb-3\"},[_c('b-container',{staticClass:\"col-12 mr-auto m-3 mb-4 p-2 ml-auto margin5 background-bluish\",attrs:{\"fluid\":\"\"}},[_c('b-row',[_c('b-col',{staticClass:\"text-center text-size-big\"},[_vm._v(\" Present perfect continous \")])],1)],1),_c('b-container',{staticClass:\"col-12 mr-auto ml-auto background-bluish p-3\",attrs:{\"fluid\":\"\"}},[_c('b-row',[_c('b-col',{staticClass:\"text-left margin4\"},[_c('p',[_c('b',{staticClass:\"text-danger\"},[_vm._v(\"1.

Get Better at Scanning</b>\r\n<p>\r\n    Scanning is a reading method that allows you to find information faster. When scanning, you no longer read everything word for word. You just move your eyes across the text smoothly in a wavelike motion. You don’t stop to read details and you don’t waste time with unnecessary information. This is a great method for understanding the main ideas of a text and for finding the information you’ll want to read in more detail.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    When you really want to understand a text, you’ll want to understand what each paragraph says. Each paragraph has a main idea and that idea is expressed in the topic sentence. You don’t have time to read all the details and that’s okay because most of them aren’t needed to answer the questions correctly. What you really need to understand each paragraph is the information in the topic sentence.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    So, where do you find the topic sentence?\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    Usually, it’s the first sentence of a paragraph, but it can also appear at the end. It’s the sentence that expresses the main idea of the whole paragraph. Topic sentences are easy to recognize because they sound like they’re announcing what’s coming next. Something like “There are many advantages to using intranets in companies nowadays” is the topic sentence of a paragraph that’s going to discuss advantages of intranets. To maximize your time, look for it in the first sentence, then the second one and then the last one. Do this while you’re reading.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    Scanning can also help you find key words and numbers fast. While numbers are usually easy to locate, with key words you have to use your memory to find the approximate location where you read that earlier and then look for the word being discussed in more detail. You should also be looking for key words and numbers in figures, diagrams and footnotes.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<b>4. Be Cool with Vocabulary</b>\r\n<p>\r\n    Don’t panic if you come across unknown words.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    Even native speakers don’t understand every single word in every text they read and that’s okay because all those words don’t matter most of the time.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    Remember that this isn’t a vocabulary test!\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    You aren’t allowed to use dictionaries in the exam but this shouldn’t be a problem at all. You’d be wasting a lot of time in the exam by looking up every word you don’t know. So, you should forget about using them while practicing reading at home as well. When you’re practicing reading anything or taking a FCE practice test, do not use a dictionary. Make yourself complete all your reading practice first. Then, once you have completed the activity, you can return to the text and look something up afterward.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    You should be training yourself to read faster and understand overall ideas in the texts. You can understand the meaning of a sentence or paragraph even if you don’t know every single word!\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    If you want to improve your vocabulary, you can work on that separately after completing the FCE reading practice test you’re working on. There are texts with some really important words which are considered specific knowledge from a certain field and which are given in a glossary at the end of the text. Whenever you see a glossary, you should read it to improve your understanding of such texts.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    You may also come across questions which used rephrased ideas or synonyms of words that appear in the texts. For example, you may have a paragraph about the disadvantages of exposing kids to too much television. The question may not use the word “disadvantages” like the text does, but it might use a synonym such as “downsides” or “drawbacks” instead. So you’re definitely better off if your vocabulary is rich, but you still have to be cool about finding unknown words.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    Learn as much vocabulary as you can, but don’t stress if you don’t know every single word in a text.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<b>5. Improve Your Reading Speed</b>\r\n<p>\r\n    There’s only one way to do this and there’s no hiding from it: the more you read, the better and faster you get at reading.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    You should be doing practice tests to work on reading texts and questions. Even in your spare time when you’re relaxing and reading fun texts, like novels and comic books, try reading a bit faster every time. You may even want to time yourself to check if you’re making progress with your reading speed.\r\n</p>  \r\n</b-col>\r\n        </b-row>\r\n        <b-row>\r\n        <b-col class=\"text-center mt-3\">\r\n            <p class=\"text-size-big\"><router-link to=\"/Reading\" class=\"text-primary\">Return to reading</router-link></p>\r\n        </b-col>\r\n        </b-row>\r\n            </b-container>\r\n        </b-container>\r\n    </body>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport UserNavigation from '../../../src/components/UserNavigation.vue'\r\nexport default {\r\nname: 'TheoryB1ReadingTips',\r\ncomponents: \r\n{\r\n  UserNavigation,\r\n},\r\ndata: function()\r\n{\r\n  return{\r\n    IsInReading: true,\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\r\n<style scoped>\r\na\r\n{\r\n  color: black;\r\n}\r\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./TheoryB1ReadingTips2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./TheoryB1ReadingTips2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./TheoryB1ReadingTips2.vue?vue&type=template&id=53bea2aa&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./TheoryB1ReadingTips2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./TheoryB1ReadingTips2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./TheoryB1ReadingTips2.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=53bea2aa&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"53bea2aa\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('body',[(_vm.formalConsent === false)?_c('b-container',{staticClass:\"col-10 mt-5 col-md-8 col-xl-8 mr-auto ml-auto background-bluish\",attrs:{\"fluid\":\"\"}},[_c('b-row',[_c('b-col',{staticClass:\"text-center p-3\"},[_c('p',[_vm._v(\"You are in tasks section, please remember that you are constantly \"),_c('b',[_vm._v(\"LEARNING\")]),_vm._v(\" so, do not forget to make notes, and if necessary - repeat quizes!\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"You won't be scoring any points here, so do not panic if you chose a wrong answear, just pick a new one.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Finishing all quizes will allow you to make an attempt in solving the exam!\")]),_c('b-col',{staticClass:\"mt-3\"},[_c('b-button',{staticClass:\"btn btn-warning\",attrs:{\"type\":\"button\"},on:{\"click\":_vm.GiveConsent}},[_vm._v(\"Confirm\")])],1)],1)],1)],1):_vm._e(),(_vm.formalConsent === true)?_c('b-container',{staticClass:\"col-12 col-sm-10 mt-5 col-md-8 col-xl-8 mr-auto ml-auto background-bluish p-5\",attrs:{\"fluid\":\"\"}},[_c('b',[_c('h3',[_c('i',[_vm._v(\"Social networks\")])])]),_c('b',[_vm._v(\"Business applications\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" Social networks connect people at low cost; this can be beneficial for entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to expand their contact base.

When she was an old woman, she would gaze out over the lawns and say ‘Ah, Knox Road, that’s where I really came into my own’. Number 126 was only a short walk from the bus stop, and she heaved her multiple bags onto her shoulders and trudged off, trying to maintain the elation as the straps dug into the flesh of her neck and fingers. Number 126 was set back slightly from the main road, with a concrete path and weed-patch at the front. The window frames were rotten and the paint chipped. Holly tried not to mind. It was what was inside that counted, after all. The coming-together of six individuals from diverse backgrounds. discussing politics, culture and art late into the night, sharing ideas, recipes, milk, shower gel and lovers – that would be what she’d look back on of course, not the paintwork. In the absence of either a bell or knocker, she rapped firmly on the door. There was no reply. Holly peered through gap in curtains in the downstairs window, but there was nothing but gloom within. She could hear a faint thudding of a bass beat, but was not sure which house it belonged to. She rapped more firmly, and was searching for a pebble to throw to the upstairs window when the door opened.

Kicking one bag in front and dragging the others behind, she finally made it up the four flights and flung open the door to her new room, her new haven, her new adult life. Peeling beige wallpaper, a lumpy mattress on a chipboard bedframe, a bare light bulb, a flat-pack wardrobe inexpertly put together. All this, Holly could just about put up with, but when she saw the view from her window – a dull patch of grey sky, invariable whatever the angle, she finally had to admit to herself that her adult life was not getting off to a great start. \")]),_c('b-container',[_c('b-row',{staticClass:\"mt-3 mb-3\"},[_c('b-col',{staticClass:\"col-12 mr-auto ml-auto mb-2 \"},[_c('b-col',[_c('b',[_vm._v(\"1.

How many times had she been dragged up it as a child by the wrist, whining and snivelling, always wishing she were somewhere else?  Now she had no desire to be anywhere but here.  This bustling traffic, these fuming buses, these chipped paving stones and boarded-up shop fronts, they were hers.  Here, she would grow from defiant teenager to independent woman.  When she was an old woman, she would gaze out over the lawns and say ‘Ah, Knox Road, that’s where I really came into my own’.\r\n        Number 126 was only a short walk from the bus stop, and she heaved her multiple bags onto her shoulders and trudged off, trying to maintain the elation as the straps dug into the flesh of her neck and fingers.  Number 126 was set back slightly from the main road, with a concrete path and weed-patch at the front.  The window frames were rotten and the paint chipped.  Holly tried not to mind.  It was what was inside that counted, after all.  The coming-together of six individuals from diverse backgrounds. discussing politics, culture and art late into the night, sharing ideas, recipes, milk, shower gel and lovers – that would be what she’d look back on of course, not the paintwork.  In the absence of either a bell or knocker, she rapped firmly on the door.\r\n        There was no reply. Holly peered through gap in curtains in the downstairs window, but there was nothing but gloom within.  She could hear a faint thudding of a bass beat, but was not sure which house it belonged to.  She rapped more firmly, and was searching for a pebble to throw to the upstairs window when the door opened. A shirtless, overweight twenty-something, with bleary eyes and greasy hair stood in the doorway wearing boxer shorts and mismatched socks.\r\n        “I’ve come for the upstairs room, I’m the new tenant,” said Holly brightly.\r\n</p>\r\n   <p> The man grunted slightly and moved aside. He gestured up the dim, uncarpeted stairway and began to shuffle along the dark hallway to the rear of the house.</p>\r\n<p>    “Top floor, is that right?  I guess I just follow my nose!” Holly gave a high laugh, and received another grunt in reply. Then the man was gone.</p>\r\n   <p>\r\n        Not to worry, he must be the quiet moody type, thought Holly, too caught up in his own profound thoughts for inane chit-chat.  One day she would penetrate his hard outer shell and release the free spirit inside.  Anyway, now for the stairs.\r\n        The four flights of stairs would be worth it, she’d decided when she picked out the flat, even if it did mean her going downstairs to get to the bathroom, because the room faced the front, and she could watch the world scurry by as she sipped her morning coffee.  Kicking one bag in front and dragging the others behind, she finally made it up the four flights and flung open the door to her new room, her new haven, her new adult life. \r\n        Peeling beige wallpaper, a lumpy mattress on a chipboard bedframe, a bare light bulb, a flat-pack wardrobe inexpertly put together.  All this, Holly could just about put up with, but when she saw the view from her window – a dull patch of grey sky, invariable whatever the angle, she finally had to admit to herself that her adult life was not getting off to a great start.   \r\n   </p>\r\n<b-container>\r\n         <b-row class=\"mt-3 mb-3\">\r\n             <b-col class=\"col-12 mr-auto ml-auto mb-2 \">\r\n                 <b-col><b>1.

It's about four kilometres long and two kilometres wide at its broadest point, and it's joined to the mainland by a causeway called the Stand - a narrow road built across the mouth of the river which separates us from the rest of the country. Most of the time you wouldn't know we're on an island because the river mouth between us and the mainland is just a vast stretch of tall grasses and brown mud. But when there's a high tide and the water rises a half a metre or so above the road and nothing can pass until the tide goes out again a few hours later, then you know it's an island.\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    We were on our way back from the mainland. My older brother, Dominic, had just finished his first year at university in a town 150 km away. Dominic's train was due in at five and he'd asked for a lift back from the station. Now, Dad normally hates being disturbed when he's writing (which is just about all the time), and he also hates having to go anywhere, but despite the typical sighs and moans - why can't he get a taxi? what's wrong with the bus? - I could tell by the sparkle in his eyes that he was really looking forward to seeing Dominic.\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    So, anyway, Dad and I had driven to the mainland and picked up Dominic from the station. He had been talking non-stop from the moment he'd slung his rucksack in the boot and got in the car. University this, university that, writers, books, parties, people, money, gigsâ€¦. And when I say talking, I don't mean talking as in having a conversation, I mean talking as in jabbering like a mad thing. I didn't like it ... the way he spoke and waved his hands around as if he was some kind of intellectual or something. It was embarrassing. It made me feel uncomfortable - that kind of discomfort you feel when someone you like, someone close to you, suddenly starts acting like a complete idiot. And I didn't like the way he was ignoring me, either. For all the attention I was getting I might as well not have been there. I felt a stranger in my own car.\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    As we approached the island on that Friday afternoon, the tide was low and the Stand welcomed us home, stretched out before us, clear and dry, beautifully hazy in the heat - a raised strip of grey concrete bound by white railings and a low footpath on either side, with rough cobbled banks leading down to the water. Beyond the railings, the water was glinting with that wonderful silver light we sometimes get here in the late afternoon which lazes through to the early evening.\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    We were about halfway across when I saw the boy. My first thought was how odd it was to see someone walking on the Stand. You don't often see people walking around here. Between Hale and Moulton (the nearest town about thirty kilometres away on the mainland), there's nothing but small cottages, farmland, heathland and a couple of hills. So islanders don't walk because of that. If they're going to Moulton they tend to take the bus. So the only pedestrians you're likely to see around here are walkers or bird-watchers. But even from a distance I could tell that the figure ahead didn't fit into either of these categories. I wasn't sure how I knew, I just did.\r\n</p>    \r\n<p>\r\n    As we drew closer, he became clearer. He was actually a young man rather than a boy. Although he was on the small side, he wasn't as slight as I'd first thought. He wasn't exactly muscular, but he wasn't weedy-looking either. It's hard to explain. There was a sense of strength about him, a graceful strength that showed in his balance, the way he held himself, the way he walked.\r\n</p>    \r\n<b-container>\r\n         <b-row class=\"mt-3 mb-3\">\r\n             <b-col class=\"col-12 mr-auto ml-auto mb-2 \">\r\n                 <b-col><b>1.

My response was, ''Sure, why not?''  </p>\r\n\r\n     <b-container>\r\n         <b-row class=\"mt-3 mb-3\">\r\n             <b-col class=\"col-12 mr-auto ml-auto mb-2 \">\r\n                 <b-col><b>1.

This way, you can save time which should be allocated for the other sections of the exam.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    And remember, it’s not like your examiner will sit there while marking your writing by counting exactly how many words you have written (since he or she has to mark so many pieces of writing). They probably have mastered the art of approximating the word count through years of experience marking the FCE exam. So don’t worry if you go overboard for a few words, but also don't make it blatantly obvious that you have over or under written.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><b>6. Checking your written work</b></p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    I believe this step is absolutely necessary and critical in delivering a solid piece of writing -- so plan some extra time for this accordingly. Quite often, students forget to do go back and check their work. After you’ve finished your piece of writing, make sure you double back to proofread your work; check for punctuation, spelling, or grammar errors and correct any of your mistakes. You don’t want to be penalised for making basic mistakes.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    If possible, work on the other components of your FCE exam (like the multiple-choice section) and then double back to your writing. You will often find that by coming back to your writing after even just a short period of time away from it, a fresh pair of eyes will enable you to find silly mistakes which you previously did not notice whilst writing it in the first place.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Another small tip is to whisper (or mouth the words) when proofreading your writing. You will catch errors in a sentence if you find yourself unable to say sentences fluidly from one to another. So when you find yourself stuck reading a particular sentence, stop, and consider rephrasing that sentence in order to make it sound more natural.\r\n\r\n</p>    \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    As we all know, practice makes perfect, so start preparing for this qualification as early as possible. Following these six steps will surely help you improve your writing ability for the FCE and you will exceed the exam in no time. Good luck!\r\n\r\n</p>            </b-col>\r\n        </b-row>\r\n        <b-row>\r\n        <b-col class=\"text-center mt-3\">\r\n            <p class=\"text-size-big\"><router-link to=\"/Writing\" class=\"text-primary\">Return to writing</router-link></p>\r\n        </b-col>\r\n        </b-row>\r\n            </b-container>\r\n        </b-container>\r\n    </body>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport UserNavigation from '../../../src/components/UserNavigation.vue'\r\nexport default {\r\nname: 'TheoryB1ReadingTips',\r\ncomponents: \r\n{\r\n  UserNavigation,\r\n},\r\ndata: function()\r\n{\r\n  return{\r\n    IsInWriting: true,\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\r\n<style scoped>\r\na\r\n{\r\n  color: black;\r\n}\r\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./TheoryB1WritingTips1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./TheoryB1WritingTips1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./TheoryB1WritingTips1.vue?vue&type=template&id=67000391&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./TheoryB1WritingTips1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./TheoryB1WritingTips1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./TheoryB1WritingTips1.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=67000391&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"67000391\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('body',[_c('b-container',{staticClass:\"p-5 col-12 col-sm-10 mt-5 col-md-8 col-xl-8 mr-auto ml-auto background-bluish p-3\",attrs:{\"fluid\":\"\"}},[_c('b-row',[_c('b-col',{staticClass:\"text-center col-12\"},[_c('b',[_c('h3',[_c('i',{staticClass:\"text-center\"},[_vm._v(\"TASK 1\")])])]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Answer the questions in part 1 – 4 below.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"You will have about 1 min on this part\")])])],1),_c('hr'),_c('b-row',[_c('b-col',{staticClass:\"col-12 mt-3 text-center\"},[_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Tell us about a day you’ve really enjoyed recently.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Are you planning to do anything special this weekend?\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"How much time do you spend at home?\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"What did you do on your last birthday?\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Do you like cooking?\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"What’s your favourite food?\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"What’s your favourite day of the week?\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"What’s your favourite part of the day?\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Which time of year is your favourite?\")])])],1),_c('hr'),_c('b-row',[_c('b-col',{staticClass:\"text-center\"},[_c('b',[_c('h3',[_c('i',{staticClass:\"text-center\"},[_vm._v(\"TASK 2\")])])]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In this part of the test I’m going to give you two photographs.

I hardly have time to start looking round at the carefully tended flowerbeds when Chloe appears. Every bit as tall and striking as I’d expected, Chloe emerges from the house wearing an oversized man’s jacket, a delicately patterned top and jeans. Chloe is known for her slightly quirky sense of fashion and, of course, she looks great as she makes her way towards me through the flowerbeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Let’s talk in my office,’ she says, leading the way not back to the house, but instead to an ancient caravan parked up next to it. As we climb inside the compact little van, the smell of fresh baking greets us. A tiny table is piled high with cupcakes, each iced in a different colour. Chloe’s been busy, and there’s a real sense of playing tea parties in a secret den! But what else should I have expected from a woman with such a varied and interesting career?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chloe originally trained as a make-up artist, having left her home in the country at nineteen to try and make her name as a model in London, and soon got work in adverts and the fashion business. ‘I went to Japan to work for a short period, but felt very homesick at first,’ she recalls. ‘It was very demanding work and, though I met loads of nice people, it was too much to take in at nineteen. If I’d stayed longer, I might have settled in better.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside the modelling, Chloe was also beginning to make contacts in the music business. ‘I’d been the typical kid, singing with a hairbrush in front of the mirror, dreaming of being a star one day,’ she laughs. She joined a girl band which ‘broke up before we got anywhere’, before becoming the lead singer with the band Whoosh, which features on a best-selling clubbing album. Unusually though, Chloe also sings with two other bands, one based in Sweden and another in London, and each of these has a distinct style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was her work with Whoosh that originally led to Chloe’s link with Sweden. She was offered a song-writing job there with a team that was responsible for songs for some major stars, but gradually became more involved in writing music for her own band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although she now divides her time between London and Sweden, her first stay there turned out to be much longer than she’d bargained for. ‘The rooms are very tall over there and so people have these rather high beds that you climb up to,’ she explains. ‘I fell as I climbed up the ladder and cracked three ribs. Although the people at the hospital were very kind, I was stuck there for a while, which was very frustrating. Sneezing and laughing were so painful at first, let alone singing!’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was while recovering from her injuries that Chloe hit upon the idea of staging what she calls vintage fairs. ‘It was snowing in Sweden and I wanted something nice to look forward to.’ Chloe had always loved vintage clothes, particularly from the 1950s, and decided to stage an event for others who shared her passion. The first fair was held in her home village and featured stalls selling all sorts of clothes and crafts dating back to the 1950s. It was a huge hit, with 300 people turning up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘When I had the idea of the first fair, it was only meant to be a one-off, but we had so manycompliments, I decided to go ahead with more,’ says Chloe. ‘There’s something for all ages and people find old things have more character than stuff you buy in modern shops. It also fits perfectly with the idea of recycling.’ Looking round Chloe’s caravan, I can see what she means.</p>\r\n     <b-container>\r\n         <b-row class=\"mt-3 mb-3\">\r\n             <b-col class=\"col-12 mr-auto ml-auto mb-2 \">\r\n                 <b-col><b>1.
