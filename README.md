# IO_LVL_UP
My school project where I had to lead the team and create simple website.
Despite the fact, that the application is not finished, I am glad that, I have spent so much time on learning how Vue works (and I have still a lot to do in this field). Alpha 0.5.0.1 in my opinion is a half-product. I would like to end this prototype by constantly improving the page, and of course learning how Vue.js works.

This is my absolutely first contact with this kind of javascript frameworks.

In about 3 weeks I have learng something about javascript / vue.js / firebase and firestore. I have trained my skill in html/css/bootstrap. It wasn't an easy task do accomplish that. Nonetheless, I am still halfway throught this jorney.
