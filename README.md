# IO_LVL_UP

Alpha 1.0

At that version my work on the project is done. I am fully aware that there is a lot of things to improve. Especially safety, javascript, design patterns and so on. The reasons why I have finished the project so quickly are:

Complete lack of free time.
New semester of IT is beggining.
The amount of fixes, code-refactorings and general rebuilding of this app is clearly overwhealming.
I want to develop myself more in .NET field of study.
From my perspective this project has given me the awareness of multiple web development attributes like:

<p>How the DOM api works.</p>
<p>What are js frameworks, and what is Vue.js.</p>
<p>What is js and why we use it in web development.</p>
<p>How we can use bootstrap in our projects (hopefully appropriately);</p>
<p>What is aria, and why we should take care of screen readers.</p>
<p>How tiring leading a team might be.</p>
<p>Why we should use basic design patterns in our project</p>
<p>How to use Firestore+Firebase.</p>
<p>What are unit tests. (very basically)</p>
<p>How to use github.</p>
<p>What is gh-pages</p>

As I have mentioned before, the project could be easily conitnued by refactoring the whole page by learning how to properly use Vue, and of course adding more design patterns and javascript code. The site is mainly static which can be clearly concluded from the code proportions (js less than 5%!) This is not satisfying at all. Hence there is a great way to refactor the whole static quizes into dynamic ones which would make the site highly more effective. Furthermore, there is a lot of fascinating v-for loops which I haven't used at all (which could easily improve code cleanliness). There is not enough support for screen readers in the project (aria). I think that usage of forms and lack of appropriate security is also something what can be easily developed. But at this moment, I have very little knowledge about security. I also think that If my subject teacher saw this project, he would definitely add some more points to this list of bugs and problems. In conclusion: there is a lot to improve.

To sum up, this release is not something I can be proud of. However at the beggining of this project I had completly no clue how to work in js frameworks, and I had no knowledge in js at all. What I am satisfied with is the amount of work I have spent on this project and the mindful approach to my future projects.

Alpha 0.5
My school project where I had to lead the team and create simple website.
Despite the fact, that the application is not finished, I am glad that, I have spent so much time on learning how Vue works (and I have still a lot to do in this field). Alpha 0.5.0.1 in my opinion is a half-product. I would like to end this prototype by constantly improving the page, and of course learning how Vue.js works.

This is my absolutely first contact with this kind of javascript frameworks.

In about 3 weeks I have learng something about javascript / vue.js / firebase and firestore. I have trained my skill in html/css/bootstrap. It wasn't an easy task do accomplish that. Nonetheless, I am still halfway throught this jorney.
